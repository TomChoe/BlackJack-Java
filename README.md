# BlackJack - Java

## What is blackjack?
A gambling card game in which players go against the house(dealer). The objective is to get a pair of cards to have a value closest or equal to 21. The player or dealer with the higher value will win the round and if there is a tie, it is considered a push and no wagers will be lost. Players will start with a bank in order to place bets.

## Technologies
  * Java
  * Intellij IDE
  
## Installation
Make sure you are running Java 8.  Clone repository and cd into the directory containing .java files.  Enter command
'javac `*.java` to convert to .class files.  enter ' java Main ' to run application

## Unsolved problems
Not unsolved per say, just with more time I could implement more features like User and graphics

## Wins/Challenges
My biggest win overall was doing this in Java after a few days of learning the language.  There were issues with incompatible datatypes and having to create methods in classes in order to extract the data I needed to make the app run.  I had a big issue dealing with input errors but managed to figure it out in time.
